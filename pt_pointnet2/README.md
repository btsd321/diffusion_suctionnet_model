# PointNet2 Implementation in PyTorch

This project provides a complete implementation of the PointNet2 architecture using PyTorch. It is designed for point cloud processing tasks, including classification and segmentation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
pt_pointnet2/
├── src/
│   ├── __init__.py          # Initializes the src package
│   ├── pointnet2.py         # Main PointNet2 implementation
│   ├── modules/             # Contains various modules for PointNet2
│   │   ├── __init__.py      # Initializes the modules package
│   │   ├── set_abstraction.py # Implements set abstraction for point clouds
│   │   ├── feature_propagation.py # Implements feature propagation logic
│   │   └── utils.py         # Utility functions for point cloud processing
│   └── types/               # Contains type definitions and interfaces
│       └── index.py         # Type definitions for the project
├── tests/                   # Contains unit tests for the implementation
│   ├── __init__.py          # Initializes the tests package
│   └── test_pointnet2.py    # Unit tests for PointNet2
├── setup.py                 # Installation script for the package
├── requirements.txt         # Lists required Python libraries
└── README.md                # Project documentation and usage instructions
```

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the PointNet2 model, you can import it from the `src` package:

```python
from src.pointnet2 import PointNet2
```

You can then create an instance of the model and use it for your point cloud tasks.

## Testing

To run the unit tests, navigate to the `tests` directory and execute:

```
pytest test_pointnet2.py
```
